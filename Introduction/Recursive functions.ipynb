    "- An argument passed by *value* is in general a copy of the object passed. If the function modifies the argument, the modification is not visible to the caller.\n",
    "- An argument passed by *reference* **might** [\\*] allow the function modifications on the argument become visible to the caller ([\\*]: **will** if the reference is to a non-constant object, **will not** if the reference has the constant qualifier). There are two types of references, *lvalues* and *rvalues*:\n",
    "  - An *lvalue* reference is what you will encounter most of the time, and this is what most people will refer to when they talk about references in C++. It means the object in question already has an address in the program, and the caller is simply pointing to it.\n",
    "  - An *rvalue* reference does not yet have an address in the program. Examples are literals, function calls that return non-reference types, and temporary objects that are accessible only to the compiler.\n",
    "- A *pointer* is an object the value of which is an address in memory. Passing a pointer with a valid memory address acts in the same way as passing by *lvalue* reference.\n",
