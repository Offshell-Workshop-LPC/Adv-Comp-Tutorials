    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a set of tutorials over two sessions to give an overview of advanced computing topics. It is intended as an introductory material, to 'whet you appetite', so that you can explore these topics even further as you move along and do great things in research, whereever it may be even beyond CMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given we have only two sessions, they cannot be expected to cover all related topics exhaustively, but the topics I have selected cover a story that will allow you to build heterogeneous computing architectures. Ultimately, as fellow researchers, you would need to do your own investigation and develop upon this material in your own time, but hopefully, this material will act as a seed of initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topics can be vaguely separated in three categories:\n",
    "- Advanced C++ features: As much as it may sometimes be less practical to do coding with this language in terms of personal time, it is a central feature in any advanced programming interface you will encounter today, whether it may be CUDA, TensorFlow, *hls4ml*, or any other scientific resource (well, you could also learn assembly). We will be exploring concepts that progressively go beyond basic functions or class inheritance.\n",
    "- Automatic differentiation: This is a concept that is regularly used in machine learning algorithms. Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes in TensorFlow? You will take a glimpse at it by the end of these tutorials. Automatic differentiation has also been considered to augment detector response and statistical analysis, see these papers [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12483)] and [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13621)] for example, so it is not a bad idea to have some practice with it.\n",
    "- GPU programming: I could have started with abstraction interfaces such as Alpaka and Kokkos (we use Alpaka in CMS) directly. In the next decade, however, thanks to cross-industry efforts like the UXL Foundation, you may even find these interfaces get replaced by improved programming models to handle heterogeneous computing seamlessly. For that reason, it is more important to know the basics and get ready for changes in programming (and understand why they happen); that would also help you learn these abstraction interfaces in the first place anyway. There are many training resources available online, and many of them are even free of charge. I have picked [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) from NVIDIA as a way to introduce you to these concepts, but I could have equally picked [DPC++](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/videos/dpc-part-1-introduction-to-new-programming-model.html#gs.6ks805) from Intel oneAPI, or [ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/) from AMD.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do you need for this tutorial?** - Either a connection to `lxplus`/`lxplus-gpu` nodes at CERN, or Python, CUDA, and TensorFlow installed in your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where can I find the exercises/solutions?** - If you are actively participating in the tutorial right now, we will be actively communicating them. If you are connecting offline, the link to the material is posted on the Indico agenda item for the corresponding tutorial session.\n",
